    "### Text Pre-Processing and Normalization\n",
    "The main components in the text normalization pipeline are described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cleaning text**: Our text often contains unnecessary content like HTML tags, which do not add much value when analyzing sentiment. Hence we need to make sure we remove them before extracting features. The BeautifulSoup library does an excellent job in providing necessary functions for this. Our strip_html_tags(...) function enables in cleaning and stripping out HTML code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Removing accented characters**: In our dataset, we are dealing with reviews in the English language so we need to make sure that characters with any other format, especially accented characters are converted and standardized into ASCII characters. A simple example would be converting é to e. Our remove_accented_chars(...) function helps us in this respect.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Expanding contractions**:  In the English language, contractions are basically shortened versions of words or syllables. These shortened versions of existing words or phrases are created by removing specific letters and sounds. More than often vowels are removed from the words. Examples would be, do not to don’t and I would to I’d. Contractions pose a problem in text normalization because we have to deal with special characters like the apostrophe and we also have to convert each contraction to its expanded, original form. Our expand_contractions(...) function uses regular expressions and various contractions mapped in our contractions.py module to expand all contractions in our text corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Removing speical characters**: Another important task in text cleaning and normalization is to remove special characters and symbols that often add to the extra noise in unstructured text. Simple regexes can be used to achieve this. Our function remove_special_characters(...) helps us remove special characters. In our code, we have retained numbers but you can also remove numbers if you do not want them in your normalized corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stemming and lemmatization**: Word stems are usually the base form of possible words that can be created by attaching affixes like prefixes and suffixes to the stem to create new words. This is known as inflection. The reverse process of obtaining the base form of a word is known as stemming. A simple example are the words WATCHES, WATCHING, and WATCHED. They have the word root stem WATCH as the base form. The nltk package offers a wide range of stemmers like the PorterStemmer and LancasterStemmer. Lemmatization is very similar to stemming, where we remove word affixes to get to the base form of a word. However the base form in this case is known as the root word but not the root stem. The difference being that the root word is always a lexicographically correct word (present in the dictionary) but the root stem may not be so. We will be using lemmatization only in our normalization pipeline to retain lexicographically correct words. The function lemmatize_text(...) helps us with this aspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Removing stopwords**: Words which have little or no significance especially when constructing meaningful features from text are also known as stopwords or stop words. These are usually words that end up having the maximum frequency if you do a simple term or word frequency in a document corpus. Words like a, an, the, and so on are considered to be stopwords. There is no universal stopword list but we use a standard English language stopwords list from nltk. You can also add your own domain specific stopwords if needed. The function remove_stopwords(...) helps us remove stopwords and retain words having the most significance and context in a corpus."
