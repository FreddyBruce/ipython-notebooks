    "# Feature Selection\n",
    "While it is good to try to engineering features that try to capture some latent representations and patterns in the underlying data, it is not always a good thing to deal with feature sets having maybe thousands\n",
    "of features or even more. Dealing with a large number of features bring us to the concept of the curse of dimensionality.  More features tend to make models more complex and difficult to interpret. Besides this, it can often lead to models over-fitting on the training data. This basically leads to a very specialized model tuned only to the data which it used for training and hence even if you get a high model performance, it will end up performing very poorly on new, previously unseen data. The ultimate objective is to select an optimal number of features to train and build models that generalize very well on the data and prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection strategies can be divided into three main areas based on the type of strategy and techniques employed for the same. They are described briefly as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Filter methods**: These techniques select features purely based on metrics like correlation, mutual information and so on. These methods do not depend on results obtained from any model and usually check the relationship of each feature with the response variable to be predicted. Popular methods include threshold based methods and statistical tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Wrapper methods**: These techniques try to capture interaction between multiple features by using a recursive approach to build multiple models using feature subsets and select the best subset of features giving us the best performing model. Methods like backward selecting and forward elimination are popular wrapper based methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Embedded methods**: These techniques try to combine the benefits of the other two methods by leveraging Machine Learning models themselves to rank and score feature variables based on their importance. Tree based methods like decision trees and ensemble methods like random forests are popular examples of embedded methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of feature selection include better performing models, less overfitting, more generalized models, less time for computations and model training, and to get a good insight into understanding\n",
    "the importance of various features in your data.\n",

    "This is a filter based feature selection strategy, where you can use some form of cut-off or thresholding for limiting the total number of features during feature selection. Thresholds can be of various forms. Some of them can be used during feature selection. Some of them can be used during the feature engineering process itself, where you can specify threshold parameters. A simple example of this would be to limit feature terms in th eBag of Words model, which we used for text based feature engineering earlier. The `scikit-learn` framework procides parameters like `min_df` and `max_df` which can be used to specify thresholds for ignoring terms which have document frequency above and below user specified thresholds."
